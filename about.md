Hi! I'm Tim. I hold an MSc in Artificial Intelligence and I am a huge fan of the subject. I'm appaled at rate at which A.I. is evolving and I'm trying my best to stay on top of the almost daily innovations. I come from a non technical background and so I was thrown in the deep end when I entered the field, having to learn a lot as I went along. While I have barley scratched the surface of machine learning and A.I. as a whole, I hope that through my musings I can distill and simplify what I know and pass it on to those who come after myself who share a similar background and make the transition into what is a hugely exciting field a little less rough.
