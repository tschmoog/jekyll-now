## Probably the best starting point

Where to start? The intention of this blog is to smooth out the the niggles of machine learning and make it as acessible to those with limited technical and mathematical experience or ability. That being said, the field of ML/AI was birthed through a combination of engineering, computer science and statistics and so one must understand the fundamentals before moving on to understand more complex matters. Because of this, I feel probability theory (alongside decision theory and information theory) is as good a place to start as any. 

Ingredients:
A fair grasp of linear algebra and calculus.

Why do we need probability theory?

All data is obtained through observation and measurement. This means noise will bleed in to the data, be it through the data not being entirely accurate or representative of a population, or through the instruments by which measurement is made having a degree of uncertainty or error. Because of this, data is useful to discover __trends__, however it is good to assume there is a degree of inaccuracy within the data, which hopefully can be accounted for when the data is looked at in aggregate. Probability theory gives us the framework to express uncertainty in a precise and quantitative manner.
