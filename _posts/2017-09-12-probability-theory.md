## Probably the best starting point

Where to start? The intention of this blog is to smooth out the the niggles of machine learning and make it as acessible to those with limited technical and mathematical experience or ability. That being said, the field of ML/AI was birthed through a combination of engineering, computer science and statistics and so one must understand the fundamentals before moving on to understand more complex matters. Because of this, I feel probability theory is as good a place to start as any. 

Ingredients:
A fair grasp of linear algebra and calculus
